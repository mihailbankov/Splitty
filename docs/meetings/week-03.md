***Agenda Items:***

Opening:
- Opening by chair (1 min)
- Check-in: How is everyone doing? (3 min)
    - General feelings about the project: 
      - Everyone felt generally productive last week. 
      - It wasn't too much work, but we finished what we needed to
      - Happy with the class structure being done
    - Did everyone do the git assignment?
      - Yes
    - Does everybody have IntellIJ configured and working(running client and server)?
      - Yes
    - Did anybody find difficulty in time management for last week's tasks?
      - Everyone found it relatively easy (except checktyle took ∼7 hours for Mihail)
      - Creating a class and test class quite rudimentary, nothing very time consuming or difficult
- Approval of the agenda - Does anyone have any additions? (up to 6-7 minutes can be added to the talking points)
  - Agenda was approved, nothing else was really added.
- Approval of last minutes - Did everyone read the minutes from the previous meeting? (1 min)
  - Last week's minutes were approved.
- Announcements by the TA (3 min)
  - Git assignment is out (whether you passed or failed)
  - Will receive email whether you passed knockout criteria in the next 2 days
  - If you do not meet the knockout criteria 2 weeks in a row you get kicked out of the course
  - The deadline for knockout criteria is Sunday night
- Presentation of the current progress to the TA (2 min)
  - Created class structure and test classes, all mapped out
  - In the server created the exchange class with tests
    - This class uses an API to exchange currencies
  - Also finished code of conduct
  - Loosely planned milestones over the next 8 weeks (will be further refined)
  - Now ready to put things in the database and create endpoints

Other notes: 
- Pipeline should be kept passing after this
- We are graded on code quality and work in progress, so should not be pushing code that is failing the pipeline onto main

Talking points:
- Tasks and planning
    - Assignment due: 8th March (1 min)
      - Mandatory
      - Have to put everything into milestones and issues on gitlab
    - Encorporating SCRUM into the team (3 min)
      - Adhere to certain roles (we are all developers)
      - Every week we have a sprint (TA meeting)
      - Every sprint has to have a certain amount of tasks (expressed as issues)
      - Have to clear these tasks by the end of the week/by the next sprint
      - Have to present sprint review to the TA every week and receive feedback
    - GitLab issues and project roadmap (2 min)
      - Have to organize user stories into issues and add them in gitlab
- Endpoints
    - Required technologies (2 min)
      - We need to use both web sockets and long polling
    - Usage planning (2 min)
      - In our meeting after this we will plan the structure of our endpoints
- Database usage
    - IDM assignment (2 min)
      - The IDM assignment uses JPA, as does this assignment, so originally we wanted to finish the IDM assignment by next meeting
      - However, in the lecture on wednesday we learned how to do the database dependencies so we no longer have our internal IDM deadline
    - Agreement on deadline for readiness (1 min)
      - Abolished (see above)
- Towards UI and working together
    - Clarifying app structure (3 min)
      - Front end: no authentication, only admin side has auth.
      - The admin control panel is up to us whether it is UI or a back log of some sort (should probably be UI still)
      - User side: users can see/edit everything and the API is open with no authentication
    - Clarifying git usage (2 min)
      - 1 group member noticed that intellij has an implemented way to commit and pull so we dont need git kraken
      - Half of the group is using github desktop, the other half is used cmd prompt
      - Ultimately personal preference which to use
    - Choosing person responsible for submissions (1 min)
      - We decided Cris will be the final submitter
      - Everyone still has to check the submission after she submits it on brightspace to make sure it is the right document

Summary of action points: Who, what, when? (2 min)
- Working on IDM assignment
- Become aquainted with the database aspect of this assignment
- Plan and code endpoints
- Be concious of SCRUM
- Plan and write up issues and milestones
- Submit code of conduct (Cris)
- Meet again straight after this meeting, on Wednesday, and on Friday


Closing:
- Feedback round: What went well and what can be improved next time? (3 min)
    - Pacing of the meetings
      - Quite good, minute taker was able to keep up, as was everyone else
      - Perhaps it was a bit fast, there were 20 minutes left, but this is not so big a problem since we covered what we needed to.
    - Time coverage in the meetings
      - As said above, we might move a bit quickly, but we feel productive and we get done what we need to in front of the TA and finish the rest amongst ourselves.
    - Coverage of topics in the meeting
      - The topics we covered were complete in the sense we know what we're going to do, but after this meeting we need to refine the details and delegate work.
    - Contribution: was everyone given the chance to express their opinions?
      - Yes, everyone felt they were heard. 
    - Reception: did everyone listen carefully in the meeting?
      - Yes, there was good back and forth discussion
    - Readiness: was everyone (especially chair and minute taker) prepared well enough for the meeting?
      - Yes, chair was very ready, minute taker was also ready
      - Individually perhaps each member was missing one thing, but all together we were prepared enough to all contribute meaningfully.
- Question round: Does anyone have anything to add before the meeting closes? (1 min)
  - No, nice meeting.
- Closure (1 min)
