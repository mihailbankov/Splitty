# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: **Pass**

Feedback: You had both a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: **Excellent**

Feedback: Agenda was uploaded in time and it followed the template. It seems that everyone read it and if there were clarifications needed they asked about it or asked to also dicuss it. In general I am quite happy on how the meeting outline was.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: There is a good amount of notes. I would like to see more specific actions assigned to specific people. For now you mainly wrote down goals for the whole team. Please in the future try stating concrete but realistic goals for everyone, so that they can then be discussed in the meeting next week.


#### Chair performance

Mark: **Excellent**

Feedback: The chair kept everyone on track and did an amazing job at asking for everyone's opinion at all times. This is exactly what I want to see! I wanted to add a comment about the meeting pace being maybe too fast but if in the feedback round everyone agreed that it was followable then it's fine as it is of course. In the feedback section you asked for specific feedback on the pacing, as well as left space for everyone to add their own thoughts which was great. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: **Excellent**

Feedback: You guys work great together! I really feel like everyone is listened to and it's an environment where it's clear that people are not afraid to ask for help from each other. I really don't have any negative remarks. Even the people that were more quiet at the beginning opened up towards the end. Keep it up!


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: You guys are doing great progress and seem to have clear goals on how to proceeed. Please make sure that the pipeline passes on main from now on. It's fine if it's only the chair that talks about the progress that was made but it would be better if the person that implemented the change could also say a few words as I expect that they will have a more clear idea about what they did (not that this was necessarily an issue this week). 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: Unfortunately there was no action list last week, I hope you can adjust to this in the next few meetings and write down a/few bullet points for each person for example. This helps me also have a better view on what (as well as the amount) everyone is working on. However from what was discussed I do feel like each member is assigned tasks and the distribution feels right.
