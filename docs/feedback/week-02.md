# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: **Pass**

Feedback:  You had both a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: **Good**


Feedback: Overall I am quite happy with this first agenda. Let me mention a few points. As you discussed during the meeting, there are certain things that will need adjustment in time estimates. That's fine, as time goes on you will figure it out. The agenda was 45 minutes, which is not bad necessarily. I would just like to mention that since you will most likely always have things to add to your agenda you could instead make it slightly shorter and instead let the "agenda additions" part of the meeting fill up the rest (it doesn't need to be full 45 minutes, you are allowed to end early as long as you covered everything that you think needs to be covered).
Either way you followed the template and for the first agenda it was more than satisfactory in all other aspects!
Also a minor detail is that under `attendes` you should write the names of the attendes, not the amount of people, but of course that's not a big deal at all.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: **Does Not apply**


#### Chair performance

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: All the items in the agenda were covered nicely, there was definitely some over-estimation of the time (as I mentioned above) but that's fine. It also would be nice if in the future the chair could be the one that make sure that everyone gets their opinion in and that the more quiet team members get the opportunity to speak (more on this in the next section). Other than that I am happy with the first chair's performance!


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: You guys are doing an amazing job at being all involved in the conversaion, you take ownership of the meeting, get stuff done effectively and efficiently. There is a minor point I have to mention: I would like to see a bit more encouragement towards the members that speak less, for example if a question is asked make sure everyone says something even if it is just agreeing with what has already been said. I would love to see you guys go around the table asking for opinions instead of just letting the more extroverted people do the talking. The chair is the main person responsible for this.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: This item of the rubric for this week is mainly focused on how you approached the technical part of getting started with the project. And I think you guys covered almost (if not) all the topics that could be covered during this meeting. You went through checkstyle, you made sure to talk about the template project and who managed to get it started already. I could not expect any code yet this week so don't worry about not having any, however keep in mind that from next week I will be expecting already something more concrete to look at :)


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Since there were no goals set last week, I will dedicate this section to your task distribution and planning for this week. You talked extensively about the code of conduct and how you want to approach finishing it up, you planned meetings for this week talk about the project structure and the code. I saw that your notes included pretty clear todos and goals for the planned meetings. I will give you your first `Excellent` based on what I saw in this meeting, but please keep in mind that next week I will be expecting much more as I will look at whether the goals you set last week are discussed/completed/in progress and check if there are any outliers in terms of work distribution, etc.
